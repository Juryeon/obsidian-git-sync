1 / DEEP FEELING AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE

The revolutionary consequences of chapter 14 can hardly be exaggerated. If living processes, guided by feeling for the whole, and guided by feeling, were to shape all acts of construction in society, then everything, nearly, that we know about modern society would be changed. Above all - and what I wish to say now is not a small thing - it means that people would have a self-awareness, a knowledge of reality and wholeness as it is, quite different from the ignorance of inner feeling we came to accept as normal in the 20th-century.
 The idea that feeling - above all feeling - should become the main anchor of the huge, hundred-million-variable process which creates life on Earth, seems hard to take seriously.
 Above all, it seems hard to implement. We live in a world of computer process, banking,  strictly controlled procedures. How is it possible to contemplate a world in which the freedom exists, that could allow natural unfolding - the unfolding governed by deep feeling - to control processes of such magnitude?
 Yet I do mean this seriously. Let me make three small points.
  (1) By feeling, the reader must remember that I mean adherence to the whole. It is not an idiosyncratic touchy-feely kind of thing, but serious, holistic connection with the whole, which provides a wholesome feeling in the actor.
