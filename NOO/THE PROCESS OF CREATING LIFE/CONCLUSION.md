1 / DEEP FEELING AS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE

The revolutionary consequences of chapter 14 can hardly be exaggerated. If living processes, guided by feeling for the whole, and guided by feeling, were to shape all acts of construction in society, then everything, nearly, that we know about modern society would be changed. Above all - and what I wish to say now is not a small thing - it means that people would have a self-awareness, a knowledge of reality and wholeness as it is, quite different from the ignorance of inner feeling we came to accept as normal in the 20th-century.
 The idea that feeling - above all feeling - should become the main anchor of the huge, hundred-million-variable process which creates life on Earth, seems hard to take seriously.
 Above all, it seems hard to implement. We live in a world of computer process, banking,  strictly controlled procedures. How is it possible to contemplate a world in which the freedom exists, that could allow natural unfolding - the unfolding governed by deep feeling - to control processes of such magnitude?
 Yet I do mean this seriously. Let me make three small points.
  (1) By feeling, the reader must remember that I mean adherence to the whole. It is not an idiosyncratic touchy-feely kind of thing, but serious, holistic connection with the whole, which provides a wholesome feeling in the actor.
  (2) Next - a feeling-guided process was typical in most human societies, during much of the Earth's history. That alone should give one pause in dismissing it too quickly. Why should it not also  be possible for us?
  (3) What I have called a feeling-based process - the fundamental process as I have described it - is demonstrably necessary for the production of living structure.
 Some writers - Lynn Marguils or James Lovelock among others - migth say that a texture of living structure on the Earth is required for Earth's survival. They argue for biological reasons, and I argue for architectural reasons, that living structure is a necessary feature of a reasonable, surviving, nourishing world. If we want an Earth which is covered with living structure then, according to what I have argued in this book, this **wholeness-based form of action** must, indded, become the norm.
  But perhaps most interesting, most inspiring, underlying the material of this book there is the vision of a world which is guided by feeling. Instead of technology, feeling: At the beginning of the 21st century, even the biologically oriented views of complexity theory, are chiefly guided by interaction of complex variables, mathematical attractors in phase space, and os on. The power of the techniques that have been elaborated  is startling. But it remains true that human beings, and human nature, are intuitively more in tune with feeling than with mathematics. Our humanity - humanity itself, our sympathy for one another, and for ourselves - all has its origin in issues concerned with archetypal feeling. From this point of view, the importance - in my view - of the techniques I have described, is their capacity to create a living world which is rooted in human feeling, because that will create a world in touch with us, with our true nature, with our humanity. The idea that **feeling itself can become both criterion and instrument** - that what is done, no matter how large or how small, can become personal, connected to the personal self of all human beings - and that this process then opens the door to a new form of society. That is truly revolutionary. That can shake the world.

2 / REPAIRING THE WHOLE

I hope I have succeeded at least this far: That the reader of this book has begun to appreciate the possibility that in the future, a new form of building and planning process must come to exist worldwide, in the sphere of human creation, and in the disciplines by which we shape the Earth and our built world upon the Earth.
Nature is able to create living structure by smooth sequences of recursively applied structure-preserving transformations, applied again and again and again to wholeness which exists on the surface of the Earth. The laws of physics, and chemistry, and hydromynamics, and the laws of complex evolution - now called non-linear dynamics or complexity theory - all of them their core suggest the same process: **The wholeness which exists gives way, incessantly, to a next wholeness, which preserves the structure of the previous one.** This happens even in the process of destruction, in the process of simplification, death, pruning. It happens, too, in the more complex two-level process we call genetic evolution.
 The key is biology. In this book I have proposed a process, able to propagate life in our built and natural enivronment, which is very similar to the way that biological processes propagate plant and animal life on Earth. A key and vitally important point is this: **The pressure towards life in the local system is congruent with a pressure towards life in the whole.** There is no conflict between the life of the parts and the life of the whole. **Every living process seeks, at every single moment, to increase the life of the parts and the life of the whole, together.**
  Autonomous and purely physical processes of this class created organic life on Earth in the pre-human era. Simliar, but human-inspired processes created the beauty of traditional towns and villages in the first human era. Similar, but more conscious processes can now be used to make buildings, rooms, streets, gardens, public squares, neighborhoods, landscape, and wilderness, even objects of daily use in our world. That, I believe, is what will come to pass in the second human era which is now just beginning.
  In principle, living processes of this class might then also be used to create everyghing else. They might, for inst
