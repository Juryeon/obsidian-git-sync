#### 12 / THE EISHIN SCHOOL PATTERN LANGUAGE

In the next (and last) example, I give excerpts from a much longer language, the list of centers for the Eishin school in Japan, constructed be-tween 1983 and 1985. The full list contained about 200 patterns, and defines a way of life for a high school and university.¹4 At our client's re-quest it was different from any existing school in Japan at that time (1981). **We can see and feel, merely by reading the names of the centers and their rough description, that what was going to happen in this new school would be very differ-ent from what we are familiar with.**

**Above all we can see this new way of life as a complete whole. The way it works is completely defined by the list of centers. Thus in all im-portant aspects the life of the new school is con-tained in these centers, and the list of centers de-fines this way of life it its entirety. This gives us tremendous insight into the vast extent to which the life of any given building or building com-plex, is defined by the list of centers which it will contain.**

  

I. GLOBAL CHARACTER

There is an outer boundary which surrounds the site.

Inside the outer boundary, there is an inner boundary which surrounds a smaller area; about one-fifth of the whole site.

The area inside the inner boundary is called the inner precinct. It is a dense area where the school and college have their major buildings.

Between the inner and outer boundary is the outer precinct: an area filled with gardens, sports fields, and various freestanding outer buildings.

The buildings and the site are given their char-acter by stone foundation walls, wood columns, white walls, a few special places with red lac-quered wood, wide overhanging roofs, dark roof surfaces, stones and grass on the ground.

  

2. THE INNER PRECINCT

The entrance to the inner precinct begins at the outer boundary. At a key point in the outer boundary, there is a gate.

This main gate is a building.

From the main gate to the inner boundary, there is an entrance street. The entrance street is flanked with walls or trees, and is extremely quiet.

Where the entrance street meets the inner boundary there is a second gate.

Inside the second gate, there is a public yard. This public yard is formed by a great hall, which forms the main side of the yard.

Beyond the public yard and through a third gate is the essential center of the school and university. This essential center is reached through several layers, which have been described. And it contains further layers and further levels of quietness, within itself.

This essential center is fairly large-itself a world, bounded, within the inner precinct and formed by paths and gates. This essential center contains a large part of the high school and a large part of the university.

Opening from this essential center are those parts of the university and high school which are specialized and separate.

Since the essential center is at one and the same time, the heart and crossroads of the school and university, it has the rough form of a cross formed by crossing paths. Because it resembles the character ta (a cross in a square) we have therefore named it the Tanoji Center.

  

At the crossing of the streets and paths which form the Tanoji Center, there is a smaller cen-ter: This place is the kernel of the busy part of the Tanoji Center.

And, opening from the far side of the Tanoji Center is a higher and most peaceful place that we call the college cloister. This is the inner sanctum of the university, and the most peace-ful place of all. It is chosen to be in a place which invites contemplation.

Also opening directly from the Tanoji Center is the homebase street. The homebase street is a wide, lively, sunny street formed by the indi-vidual home room buildings where the high-school students have their classes.

Opening through gates on another side of the Tanoji Center is a lawn. This lawn, especially for the use of college students, is surrounded by the college buildings, and leads directly to the lake.

The lake is a peaceful place, to rest....

  

A further excerpt from the pattern language gives some of the details:

  

8. INTERIOR CHARACTER

The interior character is warm and subdued: wooden columns, floors and walls in places; pale yellow wall color, comparable to golden chrysanthemums, paper or silk; near-white sliding screens and ceilings.

Floors of many buildings are raised, slightly more than usual, off the ground.

Classrooms have polished wooden floors, or car-pets, and shoes are not worn inside the classrooms.

All homebase classrooms have big windows fac-ing south.

Many rooms have gallery spaces to one side, where light comes in beyond, and shines through screens.

Many walls and other surfaces are wooden, with natural unfinished wood.

The classrooms and other rooms are furnished with very solid wooden desks, which several students share.

In the larger buildings, there are mirrors where students see themselves. 

Outside the buildings, there are often flower beds.

And inside, here and there, throughout the school, there are surprising soft highlights of color, shining out among the subdued colors of at the rest, a figure painted in pale kingfisher blue in one place; a golden yellow iris in another.

  

The full original pattern language which we constructed in 1982 contained about 200 centers.15 These centers, completely governed and defined the life of the school. Even before we had any idea about the physical configuration of the buildings, their shape, or design, or the way these centers were to be made real in space, it was already obvious that the school was going to be given its life to an enormous degree, merely by this list of centers. Regardless of the particular architecture which followed from this list of ge-neric centers, or the way these centers would later be embodied in a real place with real form,

the list of centers alone already defined the essen-tials of the place and its way of life, and its degree of life, to an enormous degree. 

Once again I go to a single detail in this list of centers. One of the patterns in this pattern language for the Eishin school, describes the fact that classrooms are separate buildings, and im-plies, therefore, that it is will be necessary to walk in the rain to go from class to class.

One could have made a different choice, to keep the classrooms together, and to protect stu-dents and teachers from all rain. The key centers in the two cases are these (here again I use small capitals to emphasize the entity-like character of the centers):

A standard Japanese high school contains these patterns:

  

CASE I

ONE BUILDING FOR ALL CLASSROOMS 

CLASSROOMS ATTACHED WALLS OR FLOORS BETWEEN CLASSROOMS 

COVERED PASSAGES PROTECTED FROM RAIN

  

Instead, the new kind of high school formed by our pattern language contains these patterns:

  

CASE 2

SEPARATE CLASSROOM BUILDINGS

EACH BUILDING LIKE A HOUSE

GARDENS BETWEEN CLASSROOMS

PATHS CONNECTING CLASS-ROOMS EXPOSED TO RAIN

  

In what sense is the second list more essential than the first? It is more essential, because it deals with feeling, and at a much deeper level. The sec-ond system of centers is more deeply connected to human feelings as they really are. This large topic is taken up fully in chapter 14.

It is also useful to understand that the sec-ond system is rooted more in the wholeness of the Japanese culture itself. Before we began our work in Japan, the old Eishin school (on its pre-vious site) was arranged like case 1. There was one huge block with many classrooms. But if one examined that wholeness carefully, one could see that within it (the world defined by the case 1 patterns), the truth of the second set of centers (the world defined by the case 2 patterns) lay there, latent, waiting to be derived. The desire for autonomy of different teachers, and different classes was already a real thing in their lives. The enlivening character of the rain on people's faces was even then a real thing, observable in life.

The deadening effect of being in passages all day long was also a real thing, also observable. The peo-centers of autonomous classrooms in the second list were latent in the actual existence of the people and the place as it already was. The centers of Irain on your face and centers of unprotected paths were latent in the actual existence of the people and the place, as it all was. The centers of gardens between classrooms was latent in the ac-tual existence of the people and the place as it ac-tually was then.

**What, then, defines essential centers and distinguishes them from trivial centers? The an-swer, briefly put, is this. The essential centers are those whose presence is already latent in the field - which the heart of the living structure that is already there - which summarize, or en-capsulate, the essence of the real life which is go-ing on.**

Of course, in a period of history where peo-ple like to stress the arbitrariness of all things, such an idea may seem doubtful or impossible to accept. But the crux of all life is, nevertheless, the difference between recognizing the essential thing and separating it from the trivial thing.
