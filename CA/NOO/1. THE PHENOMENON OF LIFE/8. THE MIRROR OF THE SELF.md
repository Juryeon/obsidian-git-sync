1 / INTRODUCTION
The existence of the wholeness as an objective,
neutrally existing structure, and the possibility
of seeing life in buildings as something which
emerges naturally from this wholeness as living
structure gives us a unifying picture of reality.
The concept of living structure holds the prom-
ise of understanding architecture clearly and co-
herently. It gives us a single way of talking about
function in buildings, ecology, and the beauty of
artifacts in a single language -one which shows
us the profound meaning and consequence of all
these related facets of the world, and one which,
above all, gives us an ethical view of things, be-
cause the life (really goodness) of any portion of
the world is, in this view, then an objective mat-
ter which arises from this structure.
In the next chapters, I shall show that this
view has a feature which I have not emphasized
so far: it is deeply, and necessarily connected to the
human self.
For three hundred years our mechanistic
world view has disconnected us from our selves.
We have a picture of the universe that is power-ful and apparently accurate, but no clear sense how we, our own selves, enter into this picture.
This is the famous bifurcation of nature dis-cussed by Whitehead. We have a disconnected vision of reality, which seems secure, which seems strong and objective - but which leaves me out. My experience of self, my own actual person, my existence as I experience it every day is not part of the "objective" world-picture. So, my daily encounter with the world, I have to make do with a world-picture that fails to con-nect me to the world. I flail around in it and struggle.
We shall see, in the following chapters, that this situation is changed in the world-picture which I propose. In this new world-picture, based on wholeness and the structure of centers, the connection between the outer or objective world and my experience of the self is profound and immediate. It makes sense. It is pervasive. It is direct.
To approach the new relation between self and world-picture, let us turn again to the question of how we decide which things have more life, which have less. What I have described in chapters 1 to 7 tells us that life can be seen as phenomenon which depends entirely on the ex-istence of centers in the world. Wholeness is made of centers. Centers appear in space. When the wholeness becomes profound, we experience it as life, in buildings, in other artifacts, in na-ture, even in actions. The life is able to be more profound, or less profound, because the centers themselves have different degrees of life and the life of any one center depends on the life of other centers. The life of a building thus comes about as a recursive phenomenon in which different centers prop each other up and intensify their life cooperatively. It is responsible for the func- tional life in a building (the way it works) and for the geometric life (its beauty). They are one and the same thing.
But at the bottom of all this, there is still a puzzling question, the question of the life of the centers themselves. The actual life itself which any given center possesses, its degree of life, is still not entirely clear as a concept. We cannot easily avoid the idea that space itself has the power to come to life-a center is an emerging spot life in the material substance of space itself. This is disturbing, or at least surprising, because it is inconsistent with most modern interpretations of physics. But even if we want to accept it, we still don't really know what it means. What is it? What is this thing which happens as space comes to life? What is the life of a center, which then multiplies and blossoms to form the life of build-ings, ornaments... and perhaps even the life of living things?
Everything I have been talking about de-pends on the operational validity of this idea. It
