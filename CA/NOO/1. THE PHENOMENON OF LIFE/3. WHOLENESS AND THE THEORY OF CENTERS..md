1 / INTRODUCTION
I believe we can understand how "life" is made in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-guage within which we can begin to describe the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-non, it is necessary to define something which I call "the wholeness" and also certain crucial entities which I call "centers," the building blocks of wholeness. These concepts-and therefore the chapter too-are rather abstract. However, I must ask the reader to try to grasp and use these concepts, because the wholeness as I define it, and the centers I shall define as the building blocks of wholeness are, in my view, the indispensable tools needed to understand life. With these definitions, we shall be able to see the way that life comes about (chapter 4), the structural features which all life has (chap-ter 5), the nature of function and ornament(chapter 12). Allow these pages to prepare the groundwork for our ability to understand life as a structure.

I believe we can understand how "life" is made
in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-
guage within which we can begin to describe
the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-
non, it is necessary to define something which I
call "the wholeness" and also certain crucial
entities which I call "centers," the building
blocks of wholeness. These concepts-and
therefore the chapter too-are rather abstract.
However, I must ask the reader to try to grasp
and use these concepts, because the wholeness
as I define it, and the centers I shall define as the
building blocks of wholeness are, in my view,
the indispensable tools needed to understand
life. With these definitions, we shall be able to
see the way that life comes about (chapter 4),
the structural features which all life has (chap-
ter 5), the nature of function and ornament
(chapter 12). Allow these pages to prepare the
groundwork for our ability to understand life as
a structure.
