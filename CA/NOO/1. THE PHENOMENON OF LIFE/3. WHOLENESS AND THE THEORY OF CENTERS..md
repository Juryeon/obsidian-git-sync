1 / INTRODUCTION
I believe we can understand how "life" is made in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-guage within which we can begin to describe the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-non, it is necessary to define something which I call "the wholeness" and also certain crucial entities which I call "centers," the building blocks of wholeness. These concepts-and therefore the chapter too-are rather abstract. However, I must ask the reader to try to grasp and use these concepts, because the wholeness as I define it, and the centers I shall define as the building blocks of wholeness are, in my view, the indispensable tools needed to understand life. With these definitions, we shall be able to see the way that life comes about (chapter 4), the structural features which all life has (chap-ter 5), the nature of function and ornament(chapter 12). Allow these pages to prepare the groundwork for our ability to understand life as a structure.

2 / THE IDEA OF WHOLENESS
Intuitively we may guess that the beauty of a building, its life, and its capacity to support life all come from the fact that it is working as a whole. A view of the building as a whole means that we see it as part of an extended and undi-vided continuum. It is not an isolated fragment in itself, but part of the world which includes the gardens, walls, trees, streets beyond its bound-aries, and other buildings beyond those. And it contains many wholes within it- also un-bounded and continuous in their connections. Above all, the whole is unbroken and undivided.
This rather obvious idea, though we may assume it to be true, does not yet have a precise counterpart in our professional or scientific analysis of buildings. As a general idea, whole-ness has been widely discussed by many writers in the 20th century: it is one of the main themes of contemporary thought.' In physics, the local behavior of an electron is affected by the larger configuration of the experiment in which it moves. The local behavior of a gravitational particle is affected by the large-scale gravita-tional field that is created by the particles.³ In biology, Hans Spemann's experiments have shown how the growing cells in an embryo are affected by their position in the whole. In neu-rophysiology, Karl Lashley's experiments on the engram led to his discoveries that any particular memory is encoded not at some locus, but somehow throughout the whole. In medicine, J. S. Haldane's discussion of the lung and his explanation of the impossibility of drawing any definite boundary around the organism showed that there is an inseparable quality in which or-ganism and environment are bound together and exist as one whole. In cosmology, there is Ernst Mach's principle: the idea that the gravi-tational constant, G (and hence the force of gravity), is somehow a function of all the matter existing in the universe. Recent work on the overall ecology of Earth has even shown bene-fits in regarding the whole planet as a single organism.³
**In all these examples, the wholeness is the important thing: the local parts exist chiefly in relation to the whole, and their behavior and character and structure are determined by the larger whole in which they exist and which they create.**
Although wholeness has, in this intuitive sense, played such a role in contemporary thought, no one has shown how to represent wholeness. We can talk about wholeness, we can be aware of the necessity of seeing things in their wholeness- but no one has yet formulated a way of understanding just what this wholeness is, in precise terms. We have not been able to represent the whole, or even to isolate, in precise mathematical language, what we mean by the whole.
Most artists and architects know, intuitively, that buildings also work primarily as wholes, and that the built world must therefore also be seen in its wholeness. But again as in the other cases from the recent history of science - we do not yet have the intellectual tools which show us how to do it. We do not yet have a precise model of a structure we might call "the whole-ness" of the built world, or any clear picture of the way this "wholeness" might then contribute to the behavior of the buildings and spaces, what happens there, how it affects us. Nor do we know why it would make sense to say that it is only accurate to see a building working "as a whole."
**After many years of thinking, I believe that I have been able to define, in precise language, what we mean by the wholeness of a given situa-tion. The fundamental idea is that we can define wholeness exactly as a structure.** This structure is defined in mathematical language in appendix 1. It is a rather complex structure, analogous in some ways to the underlying structures defined in topology. In the following sections I shall try to explain this idea in informal language, by means of examples.

3 / AN EXAMPLE OF THE WHOLENESS IN A SIMPLE CASE
The general idea is that the wholeness in any part of space is the structure defined by all the various coherent entities that exist in that part of space, and the way these entities are nested in and overlap each other.
To come to grips with this idea, I start by considering a very simple structure, and examin-ing it from the point of view of its wholeness. On the right is a sketch of a blank sheet of paper.
Then I place one dot on it. Although the dot is tiny, its impact on the sheet of paper is very great.
The blank sheet of paper is one whole, one kind of wholeness. With the introduction of the tiny dot, the wholeness changes dramatically. Its ge-stalt changes. We begin to experience a subtle and pervasive shift in the whole. The space changes throughout the sheet of paper (and not only where the dot is), vectors are created, dif-ferentiations reaching far beyond the dot itself occur within the space. As a whole, an entirely new configuration has come into being, and this configuration extends across the sheet of paper as a whole. Any reasonable description of wholeness must capture this subtle and pervasive effect. But how is it to work?
What is the configuration which exists after I place the dot? It may be described like this: around the dot, there is a kind of halo. Where the dot has been placed, a larger entity of some kind is created. Also, on each side of the dot, passing the dot tangentially, rectangles of white paper become visible, as further 'latent' entities (see diagram on next page). There are four of these rectangles, and where they cross four other rectangles are formed in the four corners of the sheet (again, see diagram). These corner rectan-gles are formed by the overlap of the other rec-tangles, but are also induced by the presence of the dots. In addition, there are rays visible: four white rays going out from the dot parallel to the sides and forming a cross; and four other rays going from the dot towards the four corners.
These four rays are not all equally strong. Their relative strength depends on where the dot is on the paper.
Therefore, including the main entity of the sheet itself, there are at least twenty entities cre-ated in the space of the paper by the dot. Just what these entities are, is not yet clear, but they are zones, visible as wholes in some fashion. All we can really say is that when we place the dot, these zones become marked in some way, they become visible, they stand out. In some fashion they become coherent, or differentiated, where before they were not. Although the precise na-ture of these entities is not yet clear, the thing that matters is that they have become more visi-ble, marked, stronger. In order to visualize the configuration, it is helpful to visualize its structure diagrammati-cally. We simply list those segments of space which are at the top of the list of relative strength as entities: 1. The sheet itself. 2. The dot. 3. The balo around the dot. 4. Bottom rectangle trapped by dot. 5. Left-hand rectangle trapped by dot. 6. Right-hand rectangle trapped by dot. 7. Top rect-angle trapped by dot. 8. Top left corner. 9. Top right corner. 10. Bottom left corner. 11. Bottom right 12. The ray going up from dot. 13. Ray going down from dot. 14. Ray going left from dot. 15. Ray going right from dot. 16. The white cross formed by these four rays. 17. Diagonal ray from dot to nearest corner. 18. Diagonal ray from dot to next corner. 19. Ray from dot to third corner. 20. Ray from dot to furthest corner.
**The basic idea of the wholeness, as I define it, is that these stronger zones or entities, to-gether, define the structure which we recognize as the wholeness of the sheet of paper with the dot. I refer to this structure as the wholeness, or W.** The formal, mathematical definition of wholeness, expressing it as a system of overlap-ping entities, is given in appendices 1 to 3.

4 / THE ORIGIN OF THE STRENGTH IN ENTITIES
What is the origin of the "strength" that makes few special segments stand out as coherent entities to create wholeness? Their strength and centeredness come from a combination of factors that all depend on the overall configuration of the space.
these are In the example of the sheet with a single dot, we have some centers at the corners zones of space which are highly differentiated.
The large rectangles which "fill" the page on the four sides of the dot are the largest symmetrical chunks of space which exist without running into an edge; they are the largest symmetries left intact by the presence of the dot. It is their ho-mogeneity which marks them. The dot itself is marked, of course, because it has a physical dif-ferentiation of color. The lines forming rays from the dot to the corner are created again by local symmetries focused on the two points that form the ends of each ray.
We can begin to give general rules which will identify the zones of space that stand out as centers in any given configuration. For example:

- The sets which appear as entities are often locally symmetrical-but not always. 
- The entities are usually bounded: that is, at their edge, there is often a sharp change of structure.
- Some of the entities are marked by an internal center where there is another change of conti-nuity near the middle of the center itself.
- There is a simplicity and regularity about these sets which marks them as wholes, and makes them function as entities.
- They are often relatively homogeneous across their interior, compared with the surrounding space.
- There is a topological connectivity in them which marks them as compact.
- They are usually — not always — convex.

This list of characteristics is incomplete, but it begins to suggest the kinds of features which cause the coherence of a segment of space to occur. ¹0 Later (chapters 4 and 5) we shall see that more complex entities are formed in far more complex ways.
The entities which come into existence in a configuration are not merely cognitive. They have a real mathematical existence, and are ac-tually occurring features of the space itself. They may be established mathematically according to the relative hierarchies of differentiation in the space. They are mathematically and physi-cally real.
And they have different degrees of strength.

5 / THE CONCEPT OF A CENTER
Let us now consider the nature of the entities from which wholeness is built. We may consider any configuration in the world, a building, a street, a room full of people playing cards, a crowd of people, a forest. Each has its wholeness.
By that I mean that there are visible within that thing, a huge number of entities, at different scales, formed very much in the ways I have de-scribed, and that the totality of these entities with the way they are nested constitute the wholeness of that thing.¹¹ We may think of these entities as parts (as they may sometimes seem to us) or as local wholes or sub-wholes. But, as I have illustrated in the case of the sheet of paper

I believe we can understand how "life" is made
in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-
guage within which we can begin to describe
the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-
non, it is necessary to define something which I
call "the wholeness" and also certain crucial
entities which I call "centers," the building
blocks of wholeness. These concepts-and
therefore the chapter too-are rather abstract.
However, I must ask the reader to try to grasp
and use these concepts, because the wholeness
as I define it, and the centers I shall define as the
building blocks of wholeness are, in my view,
the indispensable tools needed to understand
life. With these definitions, we shall be able to
see the way that life comes about (chapter 4),
the structural features which all life has (chap-
ter 5), the nature of function and ornament
(chapter 12). Allow these pages to prepare the
groundwork for our ability to understand life as
a structure.
