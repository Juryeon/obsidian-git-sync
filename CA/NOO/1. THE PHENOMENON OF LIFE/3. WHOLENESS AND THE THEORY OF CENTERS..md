1 / INTRODUCTION
I believe we can understand how "life" is made in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-guage within which we can begin to describe the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-non, it is necessary to define something which I call "the wholeness" and also certain crucial entities which I call "centers," the building blocks of wholeness. These concepts-and therefore the chapter too-are rather abstract. However, I must ask the reader to try to grasp and use these concepts, because the wholeness as I define it, and the centers I shall define as the building blocks of wholeness are, in my view, the indispensable tools needed to understand life. With these definitions, we shall be able to see the way that life comes about (chapter 4), the structural features which all life has (chap-ter 5), the nature of function and ornament(chapter 12). Allow these pages to prepare the groundwork for our ability to understand life as a structure.

2 / THE IDEA OF WHOLENESS
Intuitively we may guess that the beauty of a building, its life, and its capacity to support life all come from the fact that it is working as a whole. A view of the building as a whole means that we see it as part of an extended and undi-vided continuum. It is not an isolated fragment in itself, but part of the world which includes the gardens, walls, trees, streets beyond its bound-aries, and other buildings beyond those. And it contains many wholes within it- also un-bounded and continuous in their connections. Above all, the whole is unbroken and undivided.
This rather obvious idea, though we may assume it to be true, does not yet have a precise counterpart in our professional or scientific analysis of buildings. As a general idea, whole-ness has been widely discussed by many writers in the 20th century: it is one of the main themes of contemporary thought.' In physics, the local behavior of an electron is affected by the larger configuration of the experiment in which it moves. The local behavior of a gravitational particle is affected by the large-scale gravita-tional field that is created by the particles.³ In biology, Hans Spemann's experiments have shown how the growing cells in an embryo are affected by their position in the whole. In neu-rophysiology, Karl Lashley's experiments on the engram led to his discoveries that any particular memory is encoded not at some locus, but somehow throughout the whole. In medicine, J. S. Haldane's discussion of the lung and his explanation of the impossibility of drawing any definite boundary around the organism showed that there is an inseparable quality in which or-ganism and environment are bound together and exist as one whole. In cosmology, there is Ernst Mach's principle: the idea that the gravi-tational constant, G (and hence the force of gravity), is somehow a function of all the matter existing in the universe. Recent work on the overall ecology of Earth has even shown bene-fits in regarding the whole planet as a single organism.³
**In all these examples, the wholeness is the important thing: the local parts exist chiefly in relation to the whole, and their behavior and character and structure are determined by the larger whole in which they exist and which they create.**
Although wholeness has, in this intuitive sense, played such a role in contemporary thought, no one has shown how to represent wholeness. We can talk about wholeness, we can be aware of the necessity of seeing things in their wholeness- but no one has yet formulated a way of understanding just what this wholeness is, in precise terms. We have not been able to represent the whole, or even to isolate, in precise mathematical language, what we mean by the whole.
Most artists and architects know, intuitively, that buildings also work primarily as wholes, and that the built world must therefore also be seen in its wholeness. But again as in the other cases from the recent history of science - we do not yet have the intellectual tools which show us how to do it. We do not yet have a precise model of a structure we might call "the whole-ness" of the built world, or any clear picture of the way this "wholeness" might then contribute to the behavior of the buildings and spaces, what happens there, how it affects us. Nor do we know why it would make sense to say that it is only accurate to see a building working "as a whole."
**After many years of thinking, I believe that I have been able to define, in precise language, what we mean by the wholeness of a given situa-tion. The fundamental idea is that we can define wholeness exactly as a structure.** This structure is defined in mathematical language in appendix 1. It is a rather complex structure, analogous in some ways to the underlying structures defined in topology. In the following sections I shall try to explain this idea in informal language, by means of examples.

3 / AN EXAMPLE OF THE WHOLENESS IN A SIMPLE CASE
The general idea is that the wholeness in any part of space is the structure defined by all the various coherent entities that exist in that part of space, and the way these entities are nested in and overlap each other.
To come to grips with this idea, I start by considering a very simple structure, and examin-ing it from the point of view of its wholeness. On the right is a sketch of a blank sheet of paper.
Then I place one dot on it. Although the dot is tiny, its impact on the sheet of paper is very great.
The blank sheet of paper is one whole, one kind of wholeness. With the introduction of the tiny dot, the wholeness changes dramatically. Its ge-stalt changes. We begin to experience a subtle and pervasive shift in the whole. The space changes throughout the sheet of paper (and not only where the dot is), vectors are created, dif-ferentiations reaching far beyond the dot itself occur within the space. As a whole, an entirely new configuration has come into being, and this configuration extends across the sheet of paper as a whole. Any reasonable description of wholeness must capture this subtle and pervasive effect. But how is it to work?
What is the configuration which exists after I place the dot? It may be described like this: around the dot, there is a kind of halo. Where the dot has been placed, a larger entity of some kind is created. Also, on each side of the dot, passing the dot tangentially, rectangles of white paper become visible, as further 'latent' entities (see diagram on next page). There are four of these rectangles, and where they cross four other rectangles are formed in the four corners of the sheet (again, see diagram). These corner rectan-gles are formed by the overlap of the other rec-tangles, but are also induced by the presence of the dots. In addition, there are rays visible: four white rays going out from the dot parallel to the sides and forming a cross; and four other rays going from the dot towards the four corners.
These four rays are not all equally strong. Their relative strength depends on where the dot is on the paper.
Therefore, including the main entity of the sheet itself, there are at least twenty entities cre-ated in the space of the paper by the dot. Just what these entities are, is not yet clear, but they are zones, visible as wholes in some fashion. All we can really say is that when we place the dot, these zones become marked in some way, they become visible, they stand out. In some fashion they become coherent, or differentiated, where before they were not. Although the precise na-ture of these entities is not yet clear, the thing that matters is that they have become more visi-ble, marked, stronger. In order to visualize the configuration, it is helpful to visualize its structure diagrammati-cally. We simply list those segments of space which are at the top of the list of relative strength as entities: 1. The sheet itself. 2. The dot. 3. The balo around the dot. 4. Bottom rectangle trapped by dot. 5. Left-hand rectangle trapped by dot. 6. Right-hand rectangle trapped by dot. 7. Top rect-angle trapped by dot. 8. Top left corner. 9. Top right corner. 10. Bottom left corner. 11. Bottom right 12. The ray going up from dot. 13. Ray going down from dot. 14. Ray going left from dot. 15. Ray going right from dot. 16. The white cross formed by these four rays. 17. Diagonal ray from dot to nearest corner. 18. Diagonal ray from dot to next corner. 19. Ray from dot to third corner. 20. Ray from dot to furthest corner.
**The basic idea of the wholeness, as I define it, is that these stronger zones or entities, to-gether, define the structure which we recognize as the wholeness of the sheet of paper with the dot. I refer to this structure as the wholeness, or W.** The formal, mathematical definition of wholeness, expressing it as a system of overlap-ping entities, is given in appendices 1 to 3.

4 / THE ORIGIN OF THE STRENGTH IN ENTITIES
What is the origin of the "strength" that makes few special segments stand out as coherent entities to create wholeness? Their strength and centeredness come from a combination of factors that all depend on the overall configuration of the space.
these are In the example of the sheet with a single dot, we have some centers at the corners zones of space which are highly differentiated.
The large rectangles which "fill" the page on the four sides of the dot are the largest symmetrical chunks of space which exist without running into an edge; they are the largest symmetries left intact by the presence of the dot. It is their ho-mogeneity which marks them. The dot itself is marked, of course, because it has a physical dif-ferentiation of color. The lines forming rays from the dot to the corner are created again by local symmetries focused on the two points that form the ends of each ray.
We can begin to give general rules which will identify the zones of space that stand out as centers in any given configuration. For example:

- The sets which appear as entities are often locally symmetrical-but not always. 
- The entities are usually bounded: that is, at their edge, there is often a sharp change of structure.
- Some of the entities are marked by an internal center where there is another change of conti-nuity near the middle of the center itself.
- There is a simplicity and regularity about these sets which marks them as wholes, and makes them function as entities.
- They are often relatively homogeneous across their interior, compared with the surrounding space.
- There is a topological connectivity in them which marks them as compact.
- They are usually — not always — convex.

This list of characteristics is incomplete, but it begins to suggest the kinds of features which cause the coherence of a segment of space to occur. ¹0 Later (chapters 4 and 5) we shall see that more complex entities are formed in far more complex ways.
The entities which come into existence in a configuration are not merely cognitive. They have a real mathematical existence, and are ac-tually occurring features of the space itself. They may be established mathematically according to the relative hierarchies of differentiation in the space. They are mathematically and physi-cally real.
And they have different degrees of strength.

5 / THE CONCEPT OF A CENTER
Let us now consider the nature of the entities from which wholeness is built. We may consider any configuration in the world, a building, a street, a room full of people playing cards, a crowd of people, a forest. Each has its wholeness.
By that I mean that there are visible within that thing, a huge number of entities, at different scales, formed very much in the ways I have de-scribed, and that the totality of these entities with the way they are nested constitute the wholeness of that thing.¹¹ We may think of these entities as parts (as they may sometimes seem to us) or as local wholes or sub-wholes. But, as I have illustrated in the case of the sheet of paper and the dot, these parts and entities are rarely pre-existing. They are more often themselves created by the wholeness. This apparent paradox (seeming paradoxical only because of the simple-minded way in which it is expressed) is a funda-mental issue in the nature of wholeness: the wholeness is made of parts; the parts are created by the wholeness. To understand wholeness we must have a conception in which "parts" and wholes work in this holistic way.
To have a consistent way of talking about these entities, during recent years, I have learned to call them all (whether parts or or local wholes or hardly visible coherent entities), “centers.”
What this means is that each one of these enti-ties has, as its defining mark, the fact that it ap-pears to exist as a local center within a larger whole.
It is a phenomenon of centeredness in space.
Thus a human head, or ear, or finger is a discern-ible whole. It is also, both visually and function-ally, a center. We experience it as a center. And it is, in the end, its centeredness which is its most clear, defining mark.
In using the word center in this way, I am not referring at all to a point center like a center of gravity. I use the word center to identify an or-ganized zone of space that is to say, a distinct set of points in space, which, because of its orga-nization, because of its internal coherence, and because of its relation to its context, exhibits cen-teredness, forms a local zone of relative centered-ness with respect to the other parts of space.
When I use the word center, I am always referring to a physical set, a distinct physical system, which oc-cupies a certain volume in space, and has a special marked coherence. Even when the center is a social or cultural center, it is still ultimately spatial as well: it occurs in space, and always has a spatial locus.
There is a mathematical reason for thinking of the coherent entities in the world as centers, not as wholes. If I want to be accurate about a whole, it is natural for me to ask where that whole starts and stops. Suppose, for example, I am talking about a fishpond, and want to call it a whole. To be accurate about it in a mathematical theory, I want be able to draw a precise boundary around this whole, and say for each point in space whether it is part of this set of points or not. But this is very hard to do. Obviously the water is part of the fishpond. What about the concrete it is made of, or the clay under the ground? Is this part of the whole we call "the pond"? How deep does it go? Do I include the air which is just above the pond? Is that part of the pond? What about the pipes bringing in the water? These are uncomfortable questions, and they are not trivial. There is no natural way to draw a boundary around the pond which gets just the right things, and leaves out just the right things. In a very rigid way of thinking, this would make it seem that the pond does not really exist as a whole. Obviously this is the wrong con-clusion. The pond does exist. Our trouble is that we don't know how to define it exactly. But the trouble comes from referring to it as a “whole.”
That kind of terminology seems to make it nec-essary for me to draw an exact boundary, includ-ing just those things which are part of the pond, and leaving out just those which aren't. That is the mistake.¹4
**When I call the pond a center, the situation changes.** I can then recognize the fact that the pond does have existence as a local center of ac-tivity: a living system. It is a focused entity. But the fuzziness of its edges becomes less problem-atic. The reason is that the pond, as an entity, is focused towards its center. It creates a field of centeredness. But, obviously, this effect falls off. The peripheral things play their role in the pond.
But I do not need to make a definite commit-ment about the edge, and what is in and what is out, because that is not the point. What matters in the existence of the pond as a coherent entity is that the organization of the pond is caused by a field effect in which the various elements work together to produce this phenomenon of a center.
This is true physically in the actual physical sys-tem of the pond: water, edge, shallows, gradi-ents, lilies-all help in the formation of the pond as a center. And it is also true mentally in my perception of that pond. That is why it is more useful, and more accurate, to call the pond a cen-
ter rather than calling it a whole. The same is true for window, door, wall, or arch. None of them can be exactly bounded. They are all enti-ties which have a fuzzy edge, and whose exis-tence lies mainly in the fact that they exist as centers in the portion of the world which they inhabit.
There is yet another reason for preferring the term "center" to the term "whole." The enti-ties we are concerned with in a building include the most ordinary elements like staircase, bath-tub, door, kitchen sink, room, ceiling, door, doorway, window, curtain, and kitchen nook.
Ultimately, in dealing with design, we have to ask, What is the proper relationship among these elements? Here again there is a powerful reason for using the term "center." **From the point of view of relationships which appear in the design, it is more useful to call the kitchen sink a "center" than a "whole."** If I call it a whole, it then exists in my mind as an isolated object. But if I call it a center, it already tells me something extra; it cre-ates a sense, in my mind, of the way the sink is going to work in the kitchen. It makes me aware of the larger pattern of things, and the way this particular element - the kitchen sink fits into that pattern, plays its role in that pattern. It makes the sink feel more like a thing which radi-ates out, extends beyond its own boundaries, and takes its part in the kitchen as a whole.
On the other hand, if I call the sink a whole I have more of a feeling of boundedness. I lose the relationships which exist among things. It is as if I have drawn a skin around the sink, made it entire within itself, but cut it off more from what surrounds it. I am therefore less aware of the re-lationships it has, or will have, or should have, with the larger kitchen, and think of it more in itself, enclosed and shut off.
On one occasion, I was discussing the con-cept of centers, as it applied to some bedroom curtains, with my wife Pamela. She made the comment that the use of the word "centers," as I had explained it to her, was already changing her view of everything around her, even as we were talking: "When I look at the curtain in the room, and think of the curtain, the curtain rod, the window, the sky, the light on the ceiling, as centers, then I become so much more cognizant of the relatedness of all things it is as though my awareness increases, almost like eating the fruit in the garden of Eden; my eyes suddenly perceive everything in such a different way; I see the world in all its relatedness, and as it really is."
The same is true of all the entities which ap-pear in the world. When I think of them as wholes, or entities, I focus on their boundedness, their separation. When I think of them as cen-ters, I become more aware of their relatedness; I see them as focal points in a larger unbroken whole and I see the world as whole.

6 / WHOLENESS AS A SUBTLE STRUCTURE
In order to understand the way that centers are induced by the surrounding wholeness, let us re-once again to abstract examples. It is essential to note that the centers always become centers as a result of the configuration as a whole. For ex-ample, if I make a square like the one in the drawing on the next page, then this square ap-pears as a strong center. If I add two black trian-gles to the configuration, then even though the square is still there, the square is no longer very strong as a center, while other triangles have be-come relatively more strong and overshadow the original center, which has now "disappeared."
Thus the strength of any given center is not merely a function of the internal shape which creates that center in itself, but comes about as a result of the influence of many other factors which extend outward in the given region of In the first sketch, the square appears as a strong center.
In the second sketch, after addition of the dark triangles,
even though the square is still there, it no longer has the
same strength as a center, because of the changed
condition in the configuration as a whole.
space, always as a result of the configuration as a whole. This follows, anyway, from the list of mathematical features which are responsible for causing the strength. Symmetry, connectedness, convexity, homogeneity, boundaries, sharp change of features, and so forth are all functions of the configuration as a whole. The centers which make up any given wholeness do not exist inde-pendently, but appear as elements which are gen-erated by the configuration as a whole. It is the large-scale features of the configuration which produce the local centers and allow the local cen-ters to 'settle out.'
The wholeness in any given part of space is highly fluid, and easily affected by very small changes of geometry. Indeed wholeness changes continuously through time, and is dependent on subtle-sometimes even minute - changes in the configurations in it and around it. This hap-pens because the centers which occur are in-duced in a very subtle fashion, and therefore change quite markedly as even small changes are made in the fine structure of the configuration.
Consider again the sheet of paper and the dot. We have seen how one dot on the blank sheet of paper induces a widespread global struc-ture in the wholeness of the sheet of paper. One little dot, whose area is no more than 0.0001 of the sheet, thoroughly changes the wholeness of the sheet.
Now look (Case 1, next page) at what hap-pens when another dot is added. Entirely differ-ent centers are strengthened, and the structure suddenly becomes like a head. Or look (Case 2)
what happens when the second dot is added in a different position. Again quite new centers are created and, as a result, the structure suddenly becomes diagonal-like, with induced triangles and an upward-thrusting diagonal line like an arrow.
Like the first dot, each of these second dots is not more than 0.0001 of the sheet. Yet again this tiny change (tiny in actual area or volume) utterly alters the wholeness of what is there. So in each case the structure, which I call "the wholeness," of a thing is extremely susceptible to relatively minor changes in its details. The wholeness changes globally-and sometimes completely as a result of very small local phys-ical changes.
Thus it is clear that the wholeness is a struc-ture of great subtlety which is induced in the whole. It cannot easily be predicted from the parts, and it is useless to think of it as a relationship "among the parts." The wholeness is an autono-mous and global structure, which is induced by the details of the configuration. It is a real physi-cal and mathematical structure in space - but it is created indirectly, by symmetries and other re-lationships which are induced in the geometry.
To grasp the nature of this subtle structure fully, we must learn to avoid the danger of trying to see centers made up of parts. Present-day conven-tional wisdom (perhaps Cartesian and mecha-nistic in origin) tells us that everything is made of parts. In particular, people believe today that every whole is made of parts. The key aspect of this belief is the idea that the parts come "before" the whole: in short, the parts exist as elements of some kind, which are then brought into relation-ship with one another, or combined, and a center is "created" out of these parts and their combina-tions as a result.
I believe accurate understanding of whole-ness is quite different. When we understand what wholeness is really like as a structure, we see that in most cases it is the wholeness which creates its parts. The center is not made from parts. Rather, it would be more true to say that most of the parts are created by the wholeness.
They settle out from the wholeness, and are cre-ated by all of it. This is analogous to the way a
