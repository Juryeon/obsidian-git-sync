1 / INTRODUCTION
I believe we can understand how "life" is made in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-guage within which we can begin to describe the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-non, it is necessary to define something which I call "the wholeness" and also certain crucial entities which I call "centers," the building blocks of wholeness. These concepts-and therefore the chapter too-are rather abstract. However, I must ask the reader to try to grasp and use these concepts, because the wholeness as I define it, and the centers I shall define as the building blocks of wholeness are, in my view, the indispensable tools needed to understand life. With these definitions, we shall be able to see the way that life comes about (chapter 4), the structural features which all life has (chap-ter 5), the nature of function and ornament(chapter 12). Allow these pages to prepare the groundwork for our ability to understand life as a structure.

2 / THE IDEA OF WHOLENESS
Intuitively we may guess that the beauty of a building, its life, and its capacity to support life all come from the fact that it is working as a whole. A view of the building as a whole means that we see it as part of an extended and undi-vided continuum. It is not an isolated fragment in itself, but part of the world which includes the gardens, walls, trees, streets beyond its bound-aries, and other buildings beyond those. And it contains many wholes within it- also un-bounded and continuous in their connections. Above all, the whole is unbroken and undivided.
This rather obvious idea, though we may assume it to be true, does not yet have a precise counterpart in our professional or scientific analysis of buildings. As a general idea, whole-ness has been widely discussed by many writers in the 20th century: it is one of the main themes of contemporary thought.' In physics, the local behavior of an electron is affected by the larger configuration of the experiment in which it moves. The local behavior of a gravitational particle is affected by the large-scale gravita-tional field that is created by the particles.³ In biology, Hans Spemann's experiments have shown how the growing cells in an embryo are affected by their position in the whole. In neu-rophysiology, Karl Lashley's experiments on the engram led to his discoveries that any particular memory is encoded not at some locus, but somehow throughout the whole. In medicine, J. S. Haldane's discussion of the lung and his explanation of the impossibility of drawing any definite boundary around the organism showed that there is an inseparable quality in which or-ganism and environment are bound together and exist as one whole. In cosmology, there is Ernst Mach's principle: the idea that the gravi-tational constant, G (and hence the force of gravity), is somehow a function of all the matter existing in the universe. Recent work on the overall ecology of Earth has even shown bene-fits in regarding the whole planet as a single organism.³
**In all these examples, the wholeness is the important thing: the local parts exist chiefly in relation to the whole, and their behavior and character and structure are determined by the larger whole in which they exist and which they create.**
Although wholeness has, in this intuitive
sense, played such a role in contemporary
thought, no one has shown how to represent
wholeness. We can talk about wholeness, we can
be aware of the necessity of seeing things in their
wholeness- but no one has yet formulated a
way of understanding just what this wholeness
is, in precise terms. We have not been able to
represent the whole, or even to isolate, in precise
mathematical language, what we mean by the
whole.
Most artists and architects know, intuitively,
that buildings also work primarily as wholes, and
that the built world must therefore also be seen
in its wholeness. But again as in the other
cases from the recent history of science - we do
not yet have the intellectual tools which show
us how to do it. We do not yet have a precise
model of a structure we might call "the whole-
ness" of the built world, or any clear picture of
the way this "wholeness" might then contribute
to the behavior of the buildings and spaces, what
happens there, how it affects us. Nor do we know
why it would make sense to say that it is only
accurate to see a building working "as a whole."
After many years of thinking, I believe that
I have been able to define, in precise language,
what we mean by the wholeness of a given situa-
tion. The fundamental idea is that we can define
wholeness exactly as a structure. This structure
is defined in mathematical language in appendix
1. It is a rather complex structure, analogous in some ways to the underlying structures defined in topology. In the following sections I shall try to explain this idea in informal language, by means of examples.

I believe we can understand how "life" is made
in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-
guage within which we can begin to describe
the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-
