1 / INTRODUCTION
I believe we can understand how "life" is made in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-guage within which we can begin to describe the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-non, it is necessary to define something which I call "the wholeness" and also certain crucial entities which I call "centers," the building blocks of wholeness. These concepts-and therefore the chapter too-are rather abstract. However, I must ask the reader to try to grasp and use these concepts, because the wholeness as I define it, and the centers I shall define as the building blocks of wholeness are, in my view, the indispensable tools needed to understand life. With these definitions, we shall be able to see the way that life comes about (chapter 4), the structural features which all life has (chap-ter 5), the nature of function and ornament(chapter 12). Allow these pages to prepare the groundwork for our ability to understand life as a structure.

2 / THE IDEA OF WHOLENESS
Intuitively we may guess that the beauty of a
building, its life, and its capacity to support life
all come from the fact that it is working as a
whole. A view of the building as a whole means
that we see it as part of an extended and undi-
vided continuum. It is not an isolated fragment
in itself, but part of the world which includes the
gardens, walls, trees, streets beyond its bound-
aries, and other buildings beyond those. And it
contains many wholes within it- also un-
bounded and continuous in their connections.
Above all, the whole is unbroken and undivided.
This rather obvious idea, though we may
assume it to be true, does not yet have a precise
counterpart in our professional or scientific
analysis of buildings. As a general idea, whole-
ness has been widely discussed by many writers
in the 20th century: it is one of the main themes
of contemporary thought.' In physics, the local
behavior of an electron is affected by the larger
configuration of the experiment in which it
moves. The local behavior of a gravitational
particle is affected by the large-scale gravita-
tional field that is created by the particles.³ In
biology, Hans Spemann's experiments have
2
shown how the growing cells in an embryo are
affected by their position in the whole. In neu-
rophysiology, Karl Lashley's experiments on the
engram led to his discoveries that any particular
memory is encoded not at some locus, but
somehow throughout the whole. In medicine,
J. S. Haldane's discussion of the lung and his
explanation of the impossibility of drawing any
definite boundary around the organism showed
that there is an inseparable quality in which or-
ganism and environment are bound together
and exist as one whole. In cosmology, there is
Ernst Mach's principle: the idea that the gravi-
tational constant, G (and hence the force of
gravity), is somehow a function of all the matter
existing in the universe. Recent work on the
overall ecology of Earth has even shown bene-fits in regarding the whole planet as a single organism.³
In all these examples, the wholeness is the important thing: the local parts exist chiefly in relation to the whole, and their behavior and character and structure are determined by the larger whole in which they exist and which they create.

I believe we can understand how "life" is made
in buildings, and I offer in what follows a lan-
guage within which we can begin to describe
the phenomenon.
In order to understand life as a phenome-
non, it is necessary to define something which I
call "the wholeness" and also certain crucial
entities which I call "centers," the building
blocks of wholeness. These concepts-and
therefore the chapter too-are rather abstract.
However, I must ask the reader to try to grasp
and use these concepts, because the wholeness
as I define it, and the centers I shall define as the
building blocks of wholeness are, in my view,
the indispensable tools needed to understand
life. With these definitions, we shall be able to
see the way that life comes about (chapter 4),
the structural features which all life has (chap-
ter 5), the nature of function and ornament
(chapter 12). Allow these pages to prepare the
groundwork for our ability to understand life as
a structure.
