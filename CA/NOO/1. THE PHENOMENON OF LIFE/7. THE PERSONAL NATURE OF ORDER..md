3 / WHOLENESS AND FEELING
Living structure is, by its very nature, personal
and feeling-endowed. The field of centers exists
in a thing to that degree to which the thing has per-
sonal feeling. To show that it is indeed a matter of
degree, visible in shadings, I start with a simple
comparison. I take two blank sheets of paper,
and put them a few inches apart, side by side. I
leave the left one blank. On the right one, I draw
a small diamond-shaped dot in the middle of
the page.
Most people will agree that there is more
feeling in the right-hand paper. It is more per-
sonal. It is also true that the field of centers is
more strongly present on the second sheet than
on the first.
You may say, "Why did you choose to put a
diamond in the middle of the paper?" Suppose I
had put a little irregular curved line somewhere
on the page. Would this still do it? Wouldn't al-
most anything put on the piece of paper have
more feeling than a blank sheet? After all, a
blank sheet of paper is so impersonal that the
comparison doesn't prove much.
So let us also take a third piece of paper, and
draw an irregular squiggle on it, and let us now
put this piece of paper to the left of the blank
one, thus, as in the second row of drawings (next
page). In this case, the paper on the left, with the
squiggle, has less feeling and is less personal than
the one with the diamond. It has even less feel-
ing than the sheet which is blank.
Let me explain this in terms of the field of
centers. If I look at the right-hand sheet of the
three, the world seems to tie itself together, it cen-
