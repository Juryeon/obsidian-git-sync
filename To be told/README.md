Include anyone who comes to mind even if that person is dead. Example: Maternal grandmother: "You're just like your Aunt Allison, trying to stir up trouble by rehashing things. There is no reason to go airing out our dirty laundry"


 6. List all the things that might hinder you from writing truthfully or writing at all. Examples: I don't want to revisit some very painful events. Writing takes so long and feels unproductive.

	10.	People. Who were your friends in high school? What nicknames did you have as you were growing up? Who took care of you when you were sick? Who has been a bad influence on you? Which relative have you been told you are "just like"? Why? Who has most impacted your life? Why? How did you meet your spouse

	18.	Sound. Imagine hearing the wind in the trees, laughter, your favorite CD, your mother's voice, chalk on a chalkboard, a gunshot, frogs in a pond, traffic, hospi- tal machinery, a phone ringing, whispers, a siren, a hymn. What events or feel- ings do you associate with these sounds?

	22.	Using the words and phrases that you jotted down under the preceding cate- gories, create your well of stories on the pages of your journal. Start by making a list of ten to fifteen scenes from your life, writing a few short phrases or sen- tences that will help you remember the scene in greater detail.

23*. You may find it easier to think of stories more organically. Think about the topic of each of the stories that you listed in your journal. On a blank page, write down these topics (for example: loneliness, joy, abandonment, rebelliousness) in various places. Then, as you remember related stories, write them near each of the story topics like spokes extending from the hub of a wheel or shoots of crabgrass. If those stories remind you of other stories, add a new spoke or shoot. By doing this you should end up with dozens of stories to add to your well of stories.

	24.	Look back over the list of scenes you wrote in your journal. What do the scenes have in common? For example, did you focus on fond memories of childhood or only on the tragic events of your life? What other types of gaps, such as peri- ods of time for which you don't have any stories, do you notice? What types of stories did you avoid altogether? List the categories you missed.

	25.	In response to question 24, fill in some of the missing scenes. Include all sorts of stories: delightful, painful, confusing, tender, brutal, secret, triumphant. Become a collector of stories. As you work through this book and additional stories come to mind, add them to your list. If you drop the bucket into your story well and it clanks on the bottom, you may need to do some digging. Try wandering through an antique shop or thrift store. Often you will see items from the years of your childhood that spark memories. Talk to people who knew you when you were in ele- mentary school. Ask your friends about their childhoods and use their memories to trigger your own. Watch an old television program or read a book that you loved when you were a child. Eat cookies and milk. Revisit places you used to live or where you went to school.

We write ultimately because it reveals not only our heart toward God, our patterns of sabotage, and our self-protective style of relating, but also the hand of a good God in our lives of relating, but also the hand of a good God in our lives and his outrageous offer to let us cowrite with him. And we write because God commands us to remember.


At what points in your life has God seemed absent? 

What have your tragedies revealed to you about God's heart for humanity? Who are the people you feel most called to love and serve, and what are their circumstances? 

What inklings do you have of God's calling for you? 

What do the themes and patterns of your life reveal about God? For instance: "My story reveals a surprising and unpredictable God who transforms shame through foolishness, violence through kindness, and arrogance through weakness."

Which stories do you most desire for God to redeem? Over what stories do you continue to wrestle with the Lord? 

What parts of your story are laced with such shame that you will not wrestle with God over them? 

Look back over the stories and fragments of stories that you have written. What does your life reveal about the person and character of God?
